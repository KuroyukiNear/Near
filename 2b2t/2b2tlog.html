<h1>Log #001</h1> <p>12 JAN 2024</p>
<p2>This will be the first day of playing on 2b2t. 2b2t in 1.19 is crazy. Wardens everywhere in Overworld and Nether spawn. I met the first player on 2b2t. He gave me an EGap and I thought he's gonna kill me but he trapped me in obsidian instead. So I mined out of the obsidian box by hand after he left. At least I got an EGap I guess. Got killed by a player for the first time. A player named <i>_Fit_mc_</i> killed me twice in Nether spawn. He's been hunting down new players as I can see the death messages in chat. I'm not going into the Nether again. Found some maps with a QR code and a Discord invite that belonged to a group named Assembly. While I was escaping spawn in the Overworld, I met a player named <i>ShindaYuki</i> who I thought was gonna kill me but didn't. He gave me 15 EChests, 63 Diamonds, 32 EGaps and 3 Totems. Such a nice guy. I messaged him arigatou then he replied good luck and logged out. Guess there's still nice people on ThE oLdEsT aNaRcHy SeRvEr In MiNeCrAfT.</p2>

<h1>Log #002</h1> <p>13 JAN 2024</p>
<p2>Second day of playing on ThE oLdEsT aNaRcHy SeRvEr In MiNeCrAfT. Still trying to escape spawn. I joined a group called Assembly and met new people. I got some kits from <b>APHEXTWlN</b> at spawn. I stayed there for some time AFK-ing and lost a kit after getting killed by <b>theoplegends</b>. I used the elytra to travel to -5k -5k but stumbled upon the Nothern Canal unintentionally. So I began walking on foot in the canal, reading signs and collecting some maparts. I found maparts of the Emperium saying “WE’RE BACK” and the Assembly’s 2b2t Comic mapart. I went into a Nether portal on the canal to find the Nether Highway and succeeded. I used elytra fly hacks to travel through the Nether Highway and went back to the Overworld after travelling for some distance. While I was searching for a good spot for my base I found three bases so I left some signs, took screenshots and continued my journey. I found a spot for my base and I placed some chests and a crafting table.</p2>
