        <p1>I hope that we can get this done before the end of 2024. Please do.
            Or I'll be needing another therapist.</p1>

        <h2>11 JAN 2024 | DevLog | <a href="../projects/ProjectIRIS.html">ProjectIRIS</a></h2>
        <p1>Started writing a dev log. Simply to let future me know that I will
            probably be having mental breakdowns while writing this code.</p1>

        <h2>12 JAN 2024 | MCLog | <a href="../2b2t/2b2tindex.html">2b2t</a></h2>
        <p1>This will be the first day of playing on 2b2t. 2b2t in 1.19 is
            crazy. Wardens everywhere in Overworld and Nether spawn. I met the
            first player on 2b2t. He gave me an EGap and I thought he's gonna
            kill me but he trapped me in obsidian instead. So I mined out of the
            obsidian box by hand after he left. At least I got an EGap I guess.
            Got killed by a player for the first time. A player named
            <i>_Fit_mc_</i> killed me twice in Nether spawn. He's been hunting
            down new players as I can see the death messages in chat. I'm not
            going into the Nether again. Found some maps with a QR code and a
            Discord invite that belonged to a group named Assembly. While I was
            escaping spawn in the Overworld, I met a player named
            <i>ShindaYuki</i> who I thought was gonna kill me but didn't. He
            gave me 15 EChests, 63 Diamonds, 32 EGaps and 3 Totems. Such a nice
            guy. I messaged him arigatou then he replied good luck and logged
            out. Guess there's still nice people on ThE oLdEsT aNaRcHy SeRvEr In
            MiNeCrAfT.</p1>

        <h2>13 JAN 2024 | MCLog | <a href="../2b2t/2b2tindex.html">2b2t</a></h2>
        <p1>Second day of playing on ThE oLdEsT aNaRcHy SeRvEr In MiNeCrAfT.
            Still trying to escape spawn. I joined a group called Assembly and
            met new people. I got some kits from <i>APHEXTWlN</i> at spawn. I
            stayed there for some time AFK-ing and lost a kit after getting
            killed by <i>theoplegends</i>. I used the elytra to travel to -5k
            -5k but stumbled upon the Nothern Canal unintentionally. So I began
            walking on foot in the canal, reading signs and collecting some
            maparts. I found maparts of the Emperium saying “WE’RE BACK” and the
            Assembly’s 2b2t Comic mapart. I went into a Nether portal on the
            canal to find the Nether Highway and succeeded. I used elytra fly
            hacks to travel through the Nether Highway and went back to the
            Overworld after travelling for some distance. While I was searching
            for a good spot for my base I found three bases so I left some
            signs, took screenshots and continued my journey. I found a spot for
            my base and I placed some chests and a crafting table.</p1>
