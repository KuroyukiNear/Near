<h1>Overview</h1>
<p1><b>Eyes in Every Corner, Whispers in Every Ear.</b></p1><br>
<p1><b>The Overseer Project - Where Every Move Echoes in the Shadows of Surveillance.</b></p1><br><br>
<p1>A Discord bot made to monitor every single activity in a specific Discord server made for this very purpose.
    A social experiment started by Near, inspired by the NoCom Exploit by the Nerds inc. on 2b2t.
    This bot will log every single user activity into a database for further analysis.
    Various user activities are being logged and monitored, including: messages sent, messages edited,
     messages deleted, voice events, user joins and leaves, and user profile changes. It also scraps all
     user data that is public, including: username, user ID, date the user joined Discord and their About Me.</p1>

I hope that we can get this done before the end of 2024. Please do. Or I'll be needing another therapist.
